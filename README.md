Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:

1. Fraud Detection Project

   Description: I have recently started working on a new project focused on fraud detection. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions. I will be using various data science techniques and algorithms to build a robust fraud detection system.
