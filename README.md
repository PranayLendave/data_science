Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:

1. Fraud Detection Project

   In this comprehensive project, I have undertaken an extensive investigation on fraud detection using transaction details in purchase scenarios. Employing a variety of advanced data science techniques, I meticulously prepared the dataset, conducted rigorous preprocessing, and employed state-of-the-art machine learning models for model training and evaluation. My approach encompassed the implementation and experimentation of various powerful algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier. By rigorously assessing their performance, I have highlighted the best-performing model, presenting detailed insights and results in the accompanying notebook.
